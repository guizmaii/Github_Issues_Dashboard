If you\r\ndeclare a field public, the field is created as private but with accessor\r\nmethods.\r\nTo allow the use of @Rule with Scala methods, this patch allows the addition\r\nof @Rule to methods. When BlockJUnit4ClassRunner retrieves the list of fields\r\nthat have the @Rule annotation, it also searches for methods with @Rule.\r\nThese methods are called and the values returned are added to the list of\r\nTestRule.\r\n\r\n@ClassRule has been similarly changed.\r\n\r\nThis is intended to be used as follows:\r\n\r\nprivate ExpectedException foobar = rules.ExpectedException.none();\r\n\r\n@Rule public ExpectedException getFoobar() {\r\n    return foobar;\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe validation is exactly the same as for the fields, i.e the methods must be\r\npublic and return a TestRule/MethodRule. In the case of @ClassRule, the\r\nmethods must also be static."

  "body" : "There was not way to modify categories outside the s/w layer until now. So for example in practical point of view you need to specify categories via properties and to make a group of categories narrow.\r\n\r\nFor my own purposes, I extended org.junit.experimental.categories.Categories and overloaded the filter. These changes can be implemented to the framework in more elegant way than creating a new custom runner.\r\n\r\nFinally my runner works as expected.\r\n\r\nAs a result, in the surefire's maven plugin i specify properties (or one of them at least) namely:\r\norg.junit.categories.included\r\norg.junit.categories.excluded\r\n\r\n<plugin>\r\n<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\r\n<artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>\r\n<version>2.6</version>\r\n<configuration>\r\n<systemPropertyVariables>\r\n<org.junit.categories.included>org/IRelationalDB.java</org.junit.categories.included>\r\n<org.junit.categories.excluded>org/IRunWithMySQL.java</org.junit.categories.excluded>\r\n</systemPropertyVariables>\r\n</configuration>\r\n</plugin>\r\n\r\nand I use the Categories runner with no restrictions in the code against the custom runner.\r\n\r\nAs an example, we have a super category org.IAllSystems, and other two sub categories org.IRelationalDB and org.INonrelationalDB, and we have two tests with concrete (non) relational Systems:\r\n\r\nclass TestDBReqNo1836 {// for relational\r\n@Test @Category(IRunWithMySQL.class) public void mySql() {}\r\n@Test @Category(IRunWithOracle.class) public void oracle() {}\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass TestDBReqNo1837 {// for non-rel\r\n@org.junit.Test @Category(IRunWithAmazonEC2.class) public void amazonEc2() {}\r\n}\r\n\r\nAfter you run the suite like this\r\n\r\n@RunWith(Categories.class)\r\n@IncludeCategory(IAllSystems.class)\r\n@SuiteClasses({TestDBReqNo1836.class, TestDBReqNo1837.class})\r\npublic final class DBTestSuite {}\r\n\r\nyou will get all tests running due to IAllSystems.\r\n\r\nSome build processes want to make the super category more narrow using my new properties and the custom runner Categories (same simple name as in junit).\r\nAll you have to do is to specify the properties like this:\r\n\r\n-Dorg.junit.categories.included=org/categories/IRelationalDB.java\r\n-Dorg.junit.categories.excluded=org/IRunWithMySQL.java\r\n\r\nThis way you will ignore non-relational systems and filter out the MySql category.\r\n\r\nVery easy to use, and no need to modify your code, and no need to make more tailore made suites -only one."

Due to e.g. performance reasons you would not reopen a new connection and close the old one.\r\nIn worst cases you want to keep the DB connection, and not to lose data with in-memory DB.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the programmer would share static context among tests through test suite.\r\nActually dangerous solution!\r\n\r\nHere i come with an update to\r\n\r\norg.junit.runners.JUnit4\r\nand org.junit.runners.Suite\r\n\r\n, where the suite tries to inject suite instance (fail-safe) in to public field on an instance of test annotated by @Parent (must be added to framework).\r\n\r\nAll loks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@RunWith(Suite.class)\r\n@SuiteClasses({MyTest.class})\r\npublic final class TestSuite implements IParentDB {\r\n    private final DBConnection connection;\r\n\r\n    public TestSuite() {\r\n        connection = new DBConnection();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n@Override\r\n    public IDBConnection getConnection() {\r\n        return connection;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n@Suite.SuiteFinished\r\n    public void done() {\r\n        if (connection != null) connection.close();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n@RunWith(org.my.JUnit4.class)\r\npublic final class MyTest {\r\n\r\n    @Parent\r\n    public IParentDB parent;\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testDB() {\r\n        assertNotNull(parent);\r\n        assertNotNull(parent.getConnection());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n, where IParentDB  is a custom type.\r\n\r\nThus all the tests similar to MyTest now are able to share DB connection without any need to maintain the test suite vice-versa.\r\n\r\nAs an advantage, the method done() in the suite is called when all tests finished.\r\n\r\nI tested in my scenario with two tests and the single instance of the suite in all the life cycle of both tests.\r\n\r\nWhen integrated to JUNit 4, we would not need to specify a custom @RunWith(org.my.JUnit4.class)."

I'd like to be able to specify some factory in annotation which will be responsible for creation of Tests. Default one then would be creating FrameworkMethods.\r\nIt would be nice to have FrameworkMethod replaced with some other object in core JUnit, which would not have a fMethod field in it. that would make extension easier."

  "body" : "This matcher is requested from practical needs, when trying to solve the following test scenario. It is currently implemented out of JUnit, and working fine against tests.\r\n\r\nThe test case is testing code statements, where their call sequences matter a lot and some of them throw exception.\r\nWhich exception is expected, and where in the call sequence, all depends on the test code itself.\r\n\r\nThus suppose this formal test case:\r\n\r\n\r\n@Test(expected = SomeException.class)\r\npublic void myTest() {\r\n    statement\r\n    statement\r\n \r\n    This block must not throw SomeException\r\n    {\r\n        statement\r\n        statement\r\n        statement\r\n    }\r\n \r\n    statement\r\n    statement\r\n}\r\n\r\nIn this particular scenarion the developer dos not want to encapsulate the middle part into an ugly and dangerous try-catch block.\r\nHere the test hehaviour wants to say that all statements are supposed to throw SomeException, except the middle part. This means that we want to keep Hamcrest in use with  assertThat() and keep the tests as much verbose as possible.\r\n\r\nThe IsThrowable Matcher has four variations, where the last two are able to put the stack trace from the failing block to description (output) stream:\r\n\r\nthrowing(Class<? extends Throwable>...  ): Matcher<IsThrowable.IBlock>\r\nnotThrowing(Class<? extends Throwable>...  ): Matcher<IsThrowable.IBlock>\r\nthrowingDeeply(Class<? extends Throwable>...  ): Matcher<IsThrowable.IBlock>\r\nnotThrowingDeeply(Class<? extends Throwable>...  ): Matcher<IsThrowable.IBlock>\r\n\r\nThe form of is(not(throwing(...))) is equivalent to the form is(notThrowing(...)).\r\nSimilar with the form of is(not(throwingDeeply(...))) which is again equivalent to is(notThrowingDeeply(...)).\r\nOnce you use the 'Deeply', you can see the stack trace of failed block.\r\nThe allOf/anyOf, and/or combination forms of multiple Matchers would not be much readable, however still correct.\r\n"

When BlockJUnit4ClassRunner retrieves the list of fields\r\nthat have the @Rule annotation, it also searches for methods with @Rule.\r\nThese methods are called and the values returned are added to the list of\r\nTestRule.\r\n\r\n@ClassRule has been similarly changed.\r\n\r\nThis is intended to be used as follows:\r\n\r\nprivate ExpectedException thrown = rules.ExpectedException.none();\r\n\r\n@Rule public ExpectedException getThrown() {\r\n    return thrown;\r\n}\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n@Rule public Timeout getTimeout() {\r\n    return new Timeout(20);\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe validation is exactly the same as for the fields, i.e the methods must be\r\npublic and return a TestRule/MethodRule.

  "body" : "### The sad story\r\n\r\nLike many other people, I have my own naming requirements for parametrized tests.  I call my tests &ldquo;data driven&rdquo;. My test method names are a low level test implementation detail, not helpful to differentiate individual tests.\r\n\r\nI solved my naming needs through a patched version of the `Parameterized` class and its `TestClassRunnerForParameters` inner class. This worked quite nicely at first. Until &ldquo;(&rdquo; and &ldquo;)&rdquo; appeared in the names of my tests.\r\n\r\nAs I found out the hard way, class `Description` has logic about what  &ldquo;(&rdquo; and &ldquo;)&rdquo; mean in a test name. The assumptions made by that class are just plain wrong in my case. Also not good, the constructor of `Description` is private. So to get what I want, I cannot resolve to the usual \"derive and change judiciously\".\r\n\r\n### My request:\r\n\r\nThe present Javadoc promises:\r\n\r\n**&ldquo;`Descriptions` ... are entirely informational. They contain no logic aside from counting their tests.&rdquo;**\r\n\r\nIn view of that Javadoc, the present `Description` code is buggy.\r\n\r\nPlease make good on that promise. In my opinion, `Descriptions` should provide access to some strings that meaningfully identify the particular test or test suite to the end user - **with no logic attached to those strings.**\r\n\r\nPlease remove all assumptions from the code that description strings can be parsed to make available class and/or method names.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nI replace &ldquo;(&rdquo; to &ldquo;[&rdquo; and &ldquo;)&rdquo; to \"]&rdquo; .\r\n\r\n(I will present these tests to a meeting of developers in a few weeks time, and those names will look *ugly* .)"
