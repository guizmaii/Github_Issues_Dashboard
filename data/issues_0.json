  "body" : "I would like to be able to hook in before and after each of the individual test runs in a theory. This is so I can rollback database transactions between each test run. I can use the junit before and after test but that is not fine grained enough as it is run before and after each theory.\r\n\r\nAlso I'm using theories with spring integration tests (AbstractTransactionalDataSourceSpringContextTests). So my test class is extending AbstractTransactionalDataSourceSpringContextTests and using the theories test runner. It would be nice to have a Spring theories runner to make it easier to hook up theories with spring Integration tests. This is how I came across this issue. But being able to hook into before and after each theory test is a nice start.\r\n\r\n"

So take $10.00 the answer would be \"ten dollars and zero cents\" for instance. It would be impossible to pass in $10.00 and verifiy that. How would we test this using theories?

(I see alternate ways of doing this that do not have this direct side effect)\n\nThere is no specific test for this improvement, since it is covered by other tests.

  "body" : "The underlying request of this issue is to run a limited amount of tests in \na concurrent manner, something that is often required when back-end systems are involved. With very large test-sets there is also a need to throttle the amount of\ntests being executed in parallel in a rational manner, a desired scenario is parallel=classes, but with a limited amount of threads (= limited number of concurrent classes).\n\nThe current implementation of ParallelComputer is also slower than Computer for all use cases I have tested. The reasons for this are as follows:\nA) Each suite gets a separate thread-pool. This pool is not shut down at the end of the suite, so the threads linger around for 60 seconds until the pool decides to terminate. If you're running 100 test classes, you can easily have several thousand threads hanging around at the end of the test-run. This is not good.\nB) Termination conditions are a maze of threads; when running with classes=methods=true, you basically end up with a separate thread for the class that's waiting for the method threads to finish. \nC) The design does not permit running with fixed-size thread-pools (at least not for methods=classes=true) , since there is potential for deadlocks. Fixed size thread-pools are important when you want to avoid bashing back-end systems in integration tests and webtests.\n\nYou may also want to have a look at my blog post on this subject: \nhttp://incodewetrustinc.blogspot.com/2009/07/run-your-junit-tests-in-parallel-with.html\n\nI have an alternate implementation which you're free to take whatever you like from ;) This implementation is not totally without issues either, especially around shutdown of the computer (I believe the computer should be responsible for determining if all the worker threads are finished)\n\ngit://github.com/krosenvold/configurable-parallel-computer.git\n\n"

  "body" : "I'm an avid user of hamcrest, and it's really confusing for other developers when they get \n\njava.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.hamcrest.Matcher.describeMismatch(Ljava/lang/Object;Lorg/hamcrest/Description;)V\n\nor some other error because we use a later version of hamcrest. It's usually a simple classpath ordering issue, but it can get in the way a bit.\n\nAs we are on a later version, we also use MatcherAssert.assertThat instead of Assert.assertThat (as it gives/gave much better error messages anyhow).\n\nWhat I would like is just to delete the hamcrest classes after the build. *If* we have a compatible version of hamcrest for Assert.assertThat() etc, then that will work, if not, then we know what to do anyhow. (as it will show the hamcrest classes.  It's quite confusing for a developer the first time they see hamcrest *inside* junit :))\n\nCheers"
