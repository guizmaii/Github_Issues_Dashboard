See discussion on this issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/KentBeck/junit/issues/95#issuecomment-1672519\r\n\r\nSo I forked KentBeck/junit, created branch merge_pullreq_228 in my repo, merged in from the repo with the changes in it, resolved conflicts, pushed my changes and generated this pull request.  The issue 95 discussion contains how I merged.  This should supercede pull request 228.\r\n\r\nThe actual conflicts were incredibly minor.  Perhaps I screwed something up, they were purely cosmetic, no code conflicts except a new test in AllTests.java.  All tests now complete in my local build (ant dist) so I presume everything's OK.\r\n\r\n    dist:\r\n         [java] JUnit version 4.10rc\r\n         [java]     .........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................I.I.......................................................................................................................................................................I.....................................................................................................\r\n         [java] Time: 6.074\r\n         [java] \r\n         [java] OK (566 tests)\r\n\r\nThe new assertEquivalent is working for me using the newly built junit4.10rc.jar."

E.g. \r\n\r\npublic class MyTestSuite extends TestCase {\r\n           public static Test suite() {\r\n              ...\r\n           }\r\n         \r\n           public void testXYZ() {\r\n               ...\r\n           }\r\n}\r\n\r\nA Category need not be specified on the test or test suite. During the Categories.CategoryFilter.shouldRun routine, Categories.CategoryFilter.parentDescription() is called (down the call stack).  The class Descrption, method methodStringMatch() contains a regex expression which doesn't account for the fDisplayName value in this particular case.  fDisplayName ends up with a value that looks like:\r\n\r\nTestSuite with 16 tests [example: com.abc.classname]\r\n\r\nOne fix would be to amend Description.methodStringMatch() to read:\r\n\r\nprivate Matcher methodStringMatcher() {\r\n                Matcher matcher = Pattern.compile(\"(.*)\\\\((.*)\\\\)\").matcher(toString());\r\n        \treturn matcher.matches()\r\n              \t\t? matcher\r\n                \t: Pattern.compile(\"(.* \\\\[.*: )(.*)\\\\]\").matcher(toString());\r\n}\r\n\r\nPlease let us know whether this fix can be applied or there is an equivalent fix to or already being applied.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\njoseph"
