  "body" : "I suggest to declare the hamcrest maven dependency as `optional` (see [here](http://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Dependencies) for further details). This makes it easier for projects to use different hamcrest versions. Additionally, if a project does not use hamcrest at all, it won't get hamcrest into it's classpath when adding a dependency to JUnit.\r\n\r\nIf I had to use a different hamcrest version, the dependency declaration would look something like this:\r\n\r\n    <dependency>\r\n      <groupId>junit</groupId>\r\n      <artifactId>junit</artifactId>\r\n      <version>4.11-beta-1</version>\r\n      <scope>test</scope>\r\n      <exclusions>\r\n        <exclusion>\r\n          <artifactId>hamcrest-core</artifactId>\r\n          <groupId>org.hamcrest</groupId>\r\n        </exclusion>\r\n      </exclusions>\r\n    </dependency>\r\n    <!-- hamcrest-library depends on hamcrest-core -->\r\n    <dependency>\r\n      <groupId>org.hamcrest</groupId>\r\n      <artifactId>hamcrest-library</artifactId>\r\n      <version>some-other-version</version>\r\n      <scope>test</scope>\r\n    </dependency>\r\n\r\nWith the hamcrest dependency being optional, there is no need to exclude it from the JUnit dependency (*). If I don't want to use hamcrest at all, I can just omit the dependency to hamcrest-library. JUnit will still be fully functional with the exception that `assertThat()` cannot be called without getting a compile error.\r\n\r\nA drawback to the `optional` declaration is that existing projects using hamcrest will not compile anymore if they don't explicitely declare a dependency to one of the hamcrest libraries. But since many projects using hamcrest have a dependency to other hamcrest libraries (e.g. hamcrest-all or hamcrest-library which all have a dependency to hamcrest-core), these compile errors should not occur very often.\r\n\r\n\r\n(*) In simple single-module projects, there is no need for the exclusion since the \"nearest\" declared dependency wins. But in more complicated project setups there are some constellations where maven resolves the wrong hamcrest version."

  "body" : "Assertions and assumptions form implicit contracts between JUnit tests and test runners. There are several ways to satisfy the assertion contract that don't need to get Hamcrest involved at all. To satisfy the assumption contract, you have to use org.junit.Assume, or construct instances of the internal AssumptionViolatedException and bring in Hamcrest as a dependency. I think it'd be a good idea to tease out Assert/Assume, and anything else that helps test writers express test outcomes (matchers, maybe?) into another library that depends on Hamcrest, and get Hamcrest out of JUnit's core.\r\n\r\nI'm imagining JUnit becoming a multi-module project (much like Hamcrest is!) with a \"core\" (annotations for methods, the internal machinery for running tests and stuff for writers of test runners), \"assertions\", \"runners\" (specific runners like Suite, Categories, Parameterized, etc. that leverage machinery from the core but needn't  be in the core itself)...maybe more.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't anticipate doing this for 4.x, but might necessitate a new major version."
