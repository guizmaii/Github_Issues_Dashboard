  "body" : "Adding SortWith Annotation to JUnit4 such that test methods defined in a\r\ntest class or test classes defined in a test suite can be executed in a\r\npredefined order.\r\n\r\nThere are four sorting methods available currently for choosing. They are\r\ndefault, jvm, name ascending and random. First three methods works exactly\r\nas same as their ancestors defined in MethodSorter class. Random sorting\r\nmethod is added due to the request of adding randomness to tests\r\nexecution. A test class annotated with random sorting method executes its\r\ntest methods in a random order. A test suites annotated with random\r\nsorting method executes its test classes in a random order.\r\n\r\nUser still could specify sorting method manually by designating a sorting\r\nrequest. Also the manually specified sorting method will override all\r\ndeclarative sorting method defined previously.\r\n\r\nCurrently I disabled MethodSorter class temporarily because I think if\r\nthis patch was accepted, it would no longer be useful.\r\n\r\nBTW this is my first attempt to be part of an open source project hence I\r\nmight omit something important. Please spare me in advance if I did\r\nsomething wrong."

In order to create a SuiteDescription you must now provide a list of children, whereas a TestDescription is generated without.\r\n\r\nI didn't make use of the annotations, as it felt wrong and way to complicated to do so. With the builder pattern we can add individual attributes without blowing up the number of constructors. Moreover, clients may write their own builders and create subclasses of SuiteDescription or TestDescription for their own needs.\r\n\r\nI think this is a solution that we can live with for a long time.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't like is, that I needed to override the addChild() method to throw an Exception in order to make the subtypes immutable. Even though the addChild() method is marked deprecated and I added a warning JavaDoc for this, maybe there is a better way to solve this. Let me know if so.\r\n\r\nI am looking forward to hearing your feedback.\r\n\r\nAll the best\r\nbechte"

An AssumptionViolationException is thrown. A custom run listener is used to distinguish the differences between @Ignored tests and tests that have had been marked with assumption failures. "

This feature may be disabled by calling Timeout.whenDebugging(true) which forces the timeout to fire even during debugging.\r\n\r\nTimeouts or time sensitive logic in the code under test is not handled by this feature and may make this unuseful in some circumstances. The important benefit of this feature is that you can suspend timeouts without any making any modifications to your test class to remove them during debugging. Anecdotally removing timeouts for debug purposes often results in developers forgetting to restore them.\r\n\r\nIn this pull-request I've enabled the feature by default. There is perhaps an argument to disable it by default and allow users to opt-in. I'm very open to discussion on this.\r\n\r\nThis feature somewhat relates to this https://github.com/junit-team/junit/issues/738\r\n\r\nI've tried to keep as close to the JUnit projects conventions but please let me know if there is anything you'd prefer to be changed."
