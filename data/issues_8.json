The only use that @Category really has at that point is at the method level, not at the class level.\r\n\r\nI came up with a spring based solution (doesn't really require much of spring, but it uses some spring utility classes, in particular ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider).  Perhaps something similar could be implemented in JUnit.  The downside to this of course is that the @Category annotation (or some other annotation) has to be at the class level in order for the class to be found.

  "body" : "I've got a number of test classes using a couple different runners (via @RunWith) and I've found a need for which a RunListener would be very helpful.  Specifically, in case of an exception thrown by Selenium 2 using a RemoteWebDriver, we will get an exception with a ScreenshotException in the exception chain.  I've a RunListener that, on failure, looks through the received exception for this ScreenshotException and saves it to disk.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can't see an easy way to inject a specific RunListener implementation onto the RunNotifier other than providing a subclass Runner.  Since I'm using a variety of runners in this case, it would mean that I'd have to subclass multiple runners to accomplish this for all tests running Selenium 2.\r\n\r\nAn easier way, I think, would be to add support for a @Listener annotation on the test class that, when present, would be instantiated and added to the notifier during the run of that class and removed when completed.  ParentRunner.run looks like a suitable place for this, unless I'm mistaken."

  "body" : "As this method is of scope `protected` in 4.8 and 4.8.1 it seems that it is (was) meant for possible overriding. Especially I use that to add from my custom `Runner` an extra `MethodRule` to the list of rules.\r\nThis allows users of the runner to not have to specify a rule as well and then minimise configuration.\r\n\r\nIf there is a clean work around this particular issue, I'm more than happy to hear about it. Looking at the code I couldn't find a clean and simple way to do this…\r\n\r\nCan the `rules` method be added back?\r\n\r\nBTW, the code for the `ActiveObjectsJUnitRunner` I am talking about is here if that helps: http://java.net/projects/activeobjects/sources/svn/content/trunk/activeobjects-test/src/main/java/net/java/ao/test/junit/ActiveObjectsJUnitRunner.java\r\n\r\nThe actual overridding of the `rules` method:\r\n\r\n````java\r\n@Override\r\n    protected List<MethodRule> rules(Object test)\r\n    {\r\n        final LinkedList<MethodRule> methodRules = new LinkedList<MethodRule>(super.rules(test));\r\n        methodRules.add(new ActiveObjectTransactionMethodRule(test, jdbcConfiguration, withIndex, tableNameConverter, fieldNameConverter));\r\n        return methodRules;\r\n    }\r\n````"

This commit comprises only those changes required in the core of JUnit -- basically adding a validator that the Theories runner can call to reject theories with generic type variables (that are hard to resolve), and deprecating FrameworkMethod#producesType, which only the Theories runner uses, and which will be supplanted by an equivalent method on ParameterSignature. Other required changes will be added to the Theories experiment once it migrates over to junit.contrib."

  "body" : "When trying to write a custom Rule for repeating execution of a test I found that once a statement passed the evaluate method call it will continue to do so regardless of the actual test result.\r\n\r\nThis only happens when a timeout value is set on the test. for instance say I have an annotation called @Repeat(int reps)\r\n\r\nI use it for annotating a method like so:\r\n    \r\n```java\r\nprivate static int count = 0;\r\n@Rule public RepeatRule = new RepeatRule();\r\n    \r\n@Test(timeout = 1000)\r\n@Repeat(reps = 2)\r\npublic void testFailOnSecondRun() {\r\n      count++;\r\n      if (count == 2)\r\n          fail(\"I failed\");\r\n}\r\n```    \r\nExpected behavior would be that the above test fails, however, it passes the test.\r\nThe reason being that the timeout value causes the statement to be decorated with a FailOnTimeout statement which has the following code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n...\r\nprivate boolean fFinished= false;\r\n...\r\n\r\n@Override\r\npublic void evaluate() throws Throwable {\r\n  Thread thread= new Thread() {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void run() {\r\n      try {\r\n        fNext.evaluate();\r\n        fFinished= true;\r\n      } catch (Throwable e) {\r\n        fThrown= e;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n};\r\nthread.start();\r\nthread.join(fTimeout);\r\nif (fFinished)\r\n  return;\r\n...\r\n```\r\nAs can be seen _fFinished_ is declared outside the **evaluate()** method and therefore once set to true once. all subsequent calls to evalute() will pass regardless of the exception thrown by the test itself.\r\n\r\nA simple fix would be to move the **_fFinished_ = false** to the start of the **evaluate()** method."
