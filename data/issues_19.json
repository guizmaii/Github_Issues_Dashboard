The general usage would be\r\nRequest.classes(Class1.class, Class2.class, ..., ClassN.class).sortWith(Sorter.RANDOM.getComparator());\r\n\r\nI find myself in need of randomly shuffling the test methods and classes to check that the tests do not depend on other tests. I could have implemented a Comparator which randomly outputs -1, or 1, but I wanted to perform an unbiased shuffle of the tests via Collections.shuffle(). I have not looked at the code for Collections.shuffle(), but I'm guessing it performs a Fisher-Yates shuffle."

I believe the concerns raised in the other PR should be addressed with this new patch. The new methods shuffled() and shuffledWith() more accurately represent what is intended to happen with the Tests, as I was implementing in the other PR. Also, the shuffledWith() takes a Random which can constructed with a set seed.\r\n\r\nSome core classes are modified, but they only add methods and do not modify any other existing code."
