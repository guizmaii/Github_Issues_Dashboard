  "body" : "I'm using JUnit 4.11 and have an abstract class that extends TestCase to perform initialization work for other TestCase classes.  In setUp() it opens a connection and a few other things and throws an exception if they are not able to be done.  In tearDown() it makes sure the connection is closed.  If an exception is thrown, tearDown() is never called.  In this abstract class I can just call tearDown(), when appropriate, but this means that if a child also implements setup() and throws it must also make sure it calls tearDown().  This seems bad to me.  I didn't see any posts/issues related to this.  Is the purpose of setUp() and tearDown() misleading or should this be fixed?\r\n\r\nCurrently to get around the problem I provided my own implementation of runBare().\r\n\r\nBelow is a simple (non abstract) class that demonstrates what I am talking about without all the details:\r\n\r\npublic class Test extends TestCase {\r\n\r\n   public void testNothing() { /* does nothing */ }\r\n\r\n   @Override\r\n   protected void setUp() throws Exception {\r\n      System.err.println(\"setUp()\");\r\n\r\n      super.setUp();\r\n\r\n      throw new RuntimeException(\"Initialization failed!\");\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   @Override\r\n   protected void tearDown() throws Exception {\r\n      System.err.println(\"tearDown()\");\r\n\r\n      super.tearDown();\r\n   }\r\n}"

  "body" : "Hi guys.\r\n\r\nThere are at least 3 well known ways to check that some exception is thrown and has specific properties (verifiable by `matcher`):\r\n\r\n`try-catch`:\r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\npublic void assertSomeExceptionIsThrown() {\r\n   try {\r\n       ... // block of code under test\r\n       fail(\"Expected test to throw SomeException\");\r\n   } catch (SomeException e) {\r\n       assertThat(e, matcher);\r\n   } catch (Throwable t) {\r\n       fail(\"Expected test to throw SomeException, but caught: \" + t);\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n`@Test(expected = ...)`:\r\n```java\r\n@Test(expected = SomeException.class)\r\npublic void assertSomeExceptionIsThrown() {\r\n   ... // block of code under test\r\n}\r\n```\r\n`@Rule`:\r\n```java\r\n@Rule\r\npublic ExpectedException thrown = ExpectedException.none();\r\n\r\n@Test\r\npublic void assertSomeExceptionIsThrown() {\r\n   thrown.expect(matcher);\r\n   ... // block of code under test\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAll the caveats of these methods are also well known. `try-catch` is very wordy and overcomplicated for the most cases. `@Test(expected = ...)` is too simple -- the only thing you can check is the class of exception. `@Rule` is a bit better but it has almost the same disadvantage. While with `@Test(expected = ...)` you cannot say where\r\nexactly the exception was thrown from, with `@Rule` you have to be cautious. You'll have to state your expectations just before the intended block of code. Otherwise JUnit will be pretty happy while you will get a false-positive test:\r\n```java\r\n@Rule\r\npublic ExpectedException thrown = ExpectedException.none();\r\n\r\n@Test\r\npublic void assertSomeExceptionIsThrown() {\r\n   thrown.expect(matcher);\r\n   ... // another block of code that can throw SomeException\r\n   ... // block of code under test\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBoth of them (`@Test(expected = ...)` and `@Rule`) have the same side effect that as soon as exception is thrown the test is over. So throwing an exception would be the last thing you can check in your test. That's not very handy for more sophisticated tests.\r\n\r\nWhat I suggest is to provide new methods in `org.junit.Assert` and `org.junit.Assume` to address the limitations of `@Test(expected = ...)` and `@Rule` and to take the best of `try-catch` while cutting the amount of boilerplate code needed for it.\r\n`org.junit.Assert`:\r\n```java\r\npublic static <T extends Throwable> void assertThrows(ThrowingBlock block, Class<T> clazz);\r\npublic static void assertNotThrows(ThrowingBlock block);\r\npublic static <T extends Throwable> void assertThrows(ThrowingBlock block, Class<T> clazz, Matcher<? super T> matcher);\r\npublic static <T extends Throwable> T assertThrowsAndReturn(ThrowingBlock block, Class<T> clazz);\r\n```\r\nWhere `ThrowingBlock` is simply a:\r\n```java\r\n/**\r\n * Piece of code which execution could result in throwing an exception.\r\n */\r\npublic interface ThrowingBlock {\r\n\r\n    void execute() throws Throwable;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSimilar methods could be included in `org.junit.Assume`.\r\n\r\nOK, here is how it's supposed to work:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\npublic void assertWithClass() {\r\n    Assert.assertThrows(new ThrowingBlock() {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void execute() throws Throwable {\r\n            account.withdraw(10);\r\n        }\r\n    }, InsufficientFundsException.class);\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Test\r\npublic void assertWithClassAndMatcher() {\r\n    Assert.assertThrows(new ThrowingBlock() {\r\n    @Override\r\n        public void execute() throws Throwable {\r\n            account.withdraw(10);\r\n        }\r\n    }, InsufficientFundsException.class, hasMessage(startsWith(\"Not enough\")));\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Test\r\npublic void assertAndReturn() {\r\n    InsufficientFundsException e = Assert.assertThrowsAndReturn(new ThrowingBlock() {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void execute() throws Throwable {\r\n            account.withdraw(10);\r\n        }\r\n    }, InsufficientFundsException.class);\r\n    // assertions go after the exception block\r\n    // which is more natural than with @Rule\r\n    assertThat(e.getMessage(), hasMessage(startsWith(\"Not enough\")));\r\n    assertTrue(e.getBalance() < e.getRequestedAmount());\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt may seem wordy, but the only thing that is big here is the the anonymous class. Boilerplate code is completely gone.\r\nThe extra bonus here is that being 100% usable right now, after release of jdk8, these methods will become even more usable:\r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\npublic void assertWithClass() {\r\n    Assert.assertThrows(() -> account.withdraw(10), InsufficientFundsException.class);\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Test\r\npublic void assertWithClassAndMatcher() {\r\n    Assert.assertThrows(() -> account.withdraw(10), InsufficientFundsException.class, hasMessage(startsWith(\"Not enough\")));\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Test\r\npublic void assertAndReturn() {\r\n    InsufficientFundsException e = Assert.assertThrowsAndReturn(() -> account.withdraw(10), InsufficientFundsException.class);\r\n    assertThat(e.getMessage(), hasMessage(startsWith(\"Not enough\")));\r\n    assertTrue(e.getBalance() < e.getRequestedAmount());\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Test\r\npublic void atmHasNoMercy() {\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_RETRIES; i++)\r\n        Assert.assertThrows(() -> account.withdraw(10), InsufficientFundsException.class);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAll this is possible with zero effort from JUnit because `ThrowingBlock` is a Functional Interface.\r\n\r\nI have working prototype of it. If you're interested I can submit it for review.\r\n\r\nThanks."

For example, the (fairly tricky) methods `getAnnotatedFieldValues` and `getAnnotatedMethodValues` were not tested, which are now provided.\r\n\r\nThe new tests make use of two new static fixture classes. These each contain two fields / methods (one matching, and one not matching the criterion) to exercise all the branches in the methods under test.\r\n\r\nThis class under test was originally mainly [tested indirectly](http://xunitpatterns.com/Obscure%20Test.html#Indirect Testing), with incomplete branch coverage. The new test cases serve to better document the behavior of this class.\r\n"
