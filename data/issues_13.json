For running all integration tests that belong to a particular category. without @Inherited annotation in org.junit.experimental.categories.Category, maven-surefire-plugin requires each test case to be annotated individually.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have the support of running all test cases that extend the parent class which has a specified category annotation ,  instead of requiring each test class to have that category annotation.\r\n\r\nI agree that changes can be made at surefire-plugin side to explicitly look for the annotation in the parent class, submitted a patch to surefire-plugin for the same: https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/SUREFIRE-829 , but things will be cleaner if @Inherited is added to Category class in junit itself.\r\n\r\nWhat are the disadvantages of this approach ? (If Category annotation is used only for grouping tests, this would be a good approach. Wouldnt it? )\r\n\r\nCan you please let me know which one is better ?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nGayathri"

  "body" : "Coming from Android Testing Framework and mobile development there are many tests that are dependent on a certain environment or configuration. Often the status of dependencies vary and it would very useful to mark tests as blocked because some precondition is not met. Many testing tools have this wider range of test result status that can be used. \r\n\r\nI have created an initial commit that would solve this problem. However if this concept is accepted I think that the patched should be redesigned so that you have a class called TestHalted (or something) that TestBlocked, TestError and TestFailure inherit from. Then each of these classes should also be responsible for their result text when producing the printout instead of hard coded values.\r\n\r\nFurther I think that if this new status is introduced Assume should not mark Tets as Ignored but rather Blocked. To me it feels strange that you have started executing a test then halt it but mark it as Igonred. I think that @Ignore is the correct way of\r\nremoving Tests from the scope.\r\n\r\nplease see:\r\nhttps://github.com/cafebabe-applications/junit/commit/e9ccdea1144c501ce24512d61fb9fb9c7bad2d8f"
