I had hoped for more convenience...\r\n\r\nBesides that I also stumbled over the fact that quite some interesting thread dump information (locks, monitors, synchronizers) can only be retrieved from ThreadMXBean from Java >= 1.6.\r\n\r\nThus, what do you think of the following naive and admittedly very ugly thoughts, when I want to have this extended thread dump?\r\n* Is any poor mans plugin/extension attempt via an non-elegant reflection based class creation (e.g. there is a system property with the full qualified name of the dumping class) thinkable?\r\n** => actually this is roughly implemented in #770\r\n* Another ugly idea would be making JUnit a multi-project with an optional 1.6 compatible part, where this extended thread dump class can be placed. Of course this then could be packaged in whatever ugly style in a single JAR and again via system property + reflection plugged in... But this gets extremely dirty..."

  "body" : "This is an attempt to start addressing: #463 Add ability for timeout to print full thread stack dump\r\n- Another attempt that allows to \"install\" an additional custom timeout handler that can optionally also add a further exception to the test timeout exception\r\n\r\n=> Extending the initial rudimentary attempt of #768 to allow \"installing\" an additional custom timeout handler (that can optionally also add a further exception to the test timeout exception) by a globally set custom timeout handler based on a system property, that is instantiated via reflection.\r\n\r\nThis custom timeout handler is also desirable to overcome the Java 1.5 compatibility requirement of JUnit, so any default timeout handler bundled with JUnit needs to adhere to this compatibility too: but quite some interesting thread dump information (locks, monitors, synchronizers) can only be retrieved from ThreadMXBean from Java >= 1.6, I think.\r\n\r\n(Note one self test still fails in Ant context, but not in Eclipse though -- why is that the case? can it be the parallel usage of a test case timeout via annotation attribute and the global test class timeout via rule kind of interfere? but why is it then working in Eclipse?)\r\n\r\nDeadlocked threads of self tests are not surviving anymore (fixed in a subsequent commit; in contrast to some infinite loop running threads from other self tests...\r\n=> In order to fix that and allow full thread stack dump in custom handler, the interrupting of the test thread was moved slightly down.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of that approach?"

  "body" : "Ideas behind this initial commit for discussion/review on global timeouts are:\r\n(1) I want to make sure that the set of unit tests really only consists of unit tests, i.e. they need to be very fast (to be executable in each incremental build), so I would like to set a global timeout (certainly not on each single test class or test case) of e.g. 50ms (in fact it should be of course even smaller, but one should scare all devs off right away...).\r\n(2) To avoid very long builds or even infinitely stuck builds due to very slow or even infinitely stuck tests by just setting a tolerant maximum timeout: again I only want to do that once (globally) for all the tests in a build.\r\n\r\nNote that different global timeout strategy variants can be useful:\r\n(a) should the global timeout conditionally override specific test timeouts that are higher then the global timeout? to make sure a maximum test duration is not exceeded; also allows to test that something really must be very quick\r\n(b) should a specific timeout always override the global timeout? e.g. to avoid the need to increase the global timeout, just because a single test takes longer\r\n\r\nThere is a test for variant (a).\r\n\r\nIn fact these two variants could even be implement at once and with two distinct system properties as there meaning is quite good expressed with:\r\n(a) global timeout\r\n(b) default timeout (i.e. if there is a more specific one for a test class -- independent of being smaller or higher -- then it takes precedence)\r\n\r\nSymbolic example usage (in e.g. Ant build script):\r\n\r\n\\<junit ...>\r\n  ...\r\n  \\<systemproperty name=\"org.junit.timeout.default\" value=\"1000\" /><!-- time unit always milliseconds -->\r\n  \\<systemproperty name=\"org.junit.timeout.global\" value=\"60000\" />\r\n\\</junit>\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"

This pull request provides a different way for building own runners. You have to create a `ParametersRunnerFactory` that creates the runners and build your own `Parameterized` runner with this factory.\r\n\r\nIMHO this is a better design because the responsibility for creating the runner for a single data set is separated from the `Parameterized` runner.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have this pull request in JUnit 4.12. Otherwise the `createRunner` will be part of `Parameterized`'s public API."

  "body" : "I am using a subclass of RunListener to listen and respond to JUnit events.  I'm having an issue handling assumptionFailures in @BeforeClass annotated methods...\r\n\r\nIn other scopes (@Test or @Before methods) assumptionFailures seem to correctly call EachTestNotifier's addFailedAssumption() and in time fireTestAssumptionFailed methods as I would expect.  This is from the ParentRunner class:\r\n\r\n    protected final void runLeaf(Statement statement, Description description,\r\n            RunNotifier notifier) {\r\n        EachTestNotifier eachNotifier = new EachTestNotifier(notifier, description);\r\n        eachNotifier.fireTestStarted();\r\n        try {\r\n            statement.evaluate();\r\n        } catch (AssumptionViolatedException e) {\r\n            eachNotifier.addFailedAssumption(e);\r\n        } catch (Throwable e) {\r\n            eachNotifier.addFailure(e);\r\n        } finally {\r\n            eachNotifier.fireTestFinished();\r\n        }\r\n    } \r\n\r\nWhen an AssumptionViolatedException is caught, listeners are notified of this.\r\n\r\nHowever, when an assumption failure is raised in a @BeforeClass annotated method instead we get a call to fireTestIgnored as can be seen here:\r\n\r\n    public void run(final RunNotifier notifier) {\r\n        EachTestNotifier testNotifier = new EachTestNotifier(notifier,\r\n                getDescription());\r\n        try {\r\n            Statement statement = classBlock(notifier);\r\n            statement.evaluate();\r\n        } catch (AssumptionViolatedException e) {\r\n            testNotifier.fireTestIgnored();\r\n        } catch (StoppedByUserException e) {\r\n            throw e;\r\n        } catch (Throwable e) {\r\n            testNotifier.addFailure(e);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow an assumption failure looks the same as an ignored test although there is no corresponding @Ignore attribute to glean any information from.\r\n\r\nWhy is an assumption failure being turned into an ignored test only in this case?  Is there a reason it can't be treated as a normal assumptionFailure?  Since there is still logic being used to determine the validity of the assumption, this isn't the same as a straight up @Ignored test."

  "body" : "My proposal is to have a Project Site for JUnit generated by every release/build.\r\n\r\nThis site (part of project webpage) will have project documentation as well as will include links to Issues/PullRequests for the particular Release on\r\nhttps://github.com/junit-team/junit/\r\n\r\nThe only thing the contributor has to do is to add a new line into `changes.xml` for his pull. The file will be located in the root of project.\r\nFor instance the issue appears in `changes.xml`:\r\n`<action dev=\"aramirez\" type=\"fix\" issue=\"800\">Fix for release JUnit 4.12</action>`\r\n\r\nAs far as I remember Stephen Connolly was working on Maven Site for the JUnit. This extends the site.\r\n\r\nFor more info, see the configuration in pom.xml and usage of changes.xml\r\nhttp://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-changes-plugin/usage.html"
