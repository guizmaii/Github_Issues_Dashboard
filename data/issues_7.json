  "body" : "Both Assert.assertArrayEquals(float[], float[], float) and Assert.assertArrayEquals(String, float[], float[], float) report AssertionFailures with doubles instead of floats. This does not seem like the desired functionality, since if you are doing a specified precision assertion about floats - the failure message should be written out as floats and not as doubles.\r\n\r\nThis is mostly because of InexactComparisonCriteria which is shared by both float and double. Constructor takes a primitive double, so when it is called by the signatures with float the float is being auto converted to a double. When InexactComparisonCriteria.assertElementsEqual() is called with floats, the type checking and casting ends up not functioning as it seems like it would for two reasons:\r\n1. delta field being stored as a double and then not cast to float means it will always match the signature (double, double, double) not (float, float, float) in the case of floats.\r\n2. there is no signature Assert.assertEquals(float, float, float) to match\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick code example to show problem:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nfloat delta = 0.0001f;\r\nint failIndex = 1;\r\nfloat[] f1 = new float[] { 0.123f, 0.9301f, 21.823f };\r\nfloat[] f2 = new float[f1.length];\r\nSystem.arraycopy(f1, 0, f2, 0, f1.length);\r\nf2[failIndex] = f2[failIndex] + (delta + 0.0001f);\r\n\r\nSystem.out.println(\"\");\r\nSystem.out.println(Arrays.toString(f1));\r\nSystem.out.println(Arrays.toString(f2));\r\nSystem.out.println(\"\");\r\n\r\nSystem.out.println(\"arrays first differed at element [\" + failIndex + \"]; expected:<\" + f1[failIndex] + \"> but was:<\" + f2[failIndex] + \">\");\r\ntry {\r\n\tAssert.assertArrayEquals(f1, f2, delta);\r\n} catch(AssertionError e) {\r\n\tSystem.out.println(e.getMessage());\r\n}\r\n```"

  "body" : "Annotations in Java 5+ are present to introduce semantics. We often add to that some kind of behavior (for example, in JUnit, the @Test annotation runs a new test case which fails or succeeds or fails). But I was wondering if it was possible to add an @Example annotation that has no behavior associated with it. Yes, an annotation that has the retention RetentionPolicy.SOURCE; I would see it being associable to ElementType.METHOD and TYPE.\r\n\r\nBut what would it mean? Well the @Example annotation would be exactly what it means: it shows that the current method is an example of how to use the code snippet that is written in the method below. This is therefore useful to write typical usage code.\r\n\r\nBut why this annotation in JUnit? Well, I think the answer is obvious, but some might say otherwise, so here I go. JUnit is extremely often used in snippets all over the internet to show how code should be written with a particular API. This code itself is very often written in the \"test\" source folder because people don't want to really create a \"usage\" source folder: it's not exactly what people are taught. In order to \"enforce\" that code should be written like that, often typical JUnit's Assert are used, and if we would simply add a @Test annotation to the method, it would pass without any issue.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that JUnit, by the absence of such an annotation, recommends to not use any annotation for these test cases, or possibly use @Ignored. This is not really explicit in this use case: people already use JUnit to create sample methods. This is only an adaptation of JUnit to the common usage.\r\n\r\nHere's how I would write such an annotation:\r\n\r\n@Retention(SOURCE)\r\n@Target({METHOD, TYPE})\r\npublic @interface Example {\r\n  Class<? extends Exception> expected();\r\n}"

The only code that will break by this change is the usage of either().and() or both().or() and both of them are most probably not what was intended and at least make the assertion less meaningful and confusing.\r\n\r\n(I suggested the same change to the according Hamcrest versions already)"
