It was just so quick and easy I thought it'd be best to get a PR in and have it rejected if need be.\r\n\r\nI recently had need to match on the type of an exception's cause, and was briefly confused by `ExpectedException#expect` taking either a `Matcher` or a `Class<? extends Throwable>`, but `expectCause` only taking a `Matcher`. Obviously, what I wanted could be achieved via `expectedCause(instanceOf(...))` (as pointed out in #337), but my dev experience would have been marginally more pleasant if I hadn't had to work this out - perhaps it's worth reconsidering this choice? This PR brings parity to the two methods.\r\n\r\nNote that if this is merged, we should probably do something similar with #778.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRowan"

  "body" : "Hi,\r\n\r\nAs of 4.11 (and specifically #343 / #339), it's no longer possible to annotate a single rule as both `@ClassRule` and `@Rule` (as the former must be static and the latter non-static).\r\n\r\nIs it still possible to have a single rule which acts both before & after the class' tests (e.g. to set up and tear down an external resource) _and_ between each tests (e.g. to reset the external resource)?\r\n\r\nIf not, is there any appetite for allowing such a thing?\r\n\r\nNote that there are currently work-arounds:\r\n1. Split the responsibilities into independent `@ClassRule` and `@Rule` implementations.\r\n2. Define a static `@ClassRule` field, then declare a non-static `@Rule` and set it's value to that of the static field.\r\n3. Create a `@Rule` that keeps static state (e.g. the external resource), and infers whether it should perform a before-class type action (e.g. set up the resource) or a per-test type action (e.g. reset the resource).\r\n\r\nThey have drawbacks, however: 1 and 2 require a developer to remember to do two things when writing their test (i.e. there are two coupled rules, and the test won't work as they expect if either is missing); 3 doesn't allow for after-class type actions (e.g. cleaning up an external resource), although these can be provided via an `@AfterClass` method (although, again, that couples two elements in the test).\r\n\r\nI'd be interested to hear of any other suggestions (either in terms of workarounds or, if there is any interest, in how support for this could be implemented as a JUnit feature).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRowan\r\n\r\nP.S.

  "body" : "I've more than once wanted to test at least some part of the exception messages our applications throw. We accept input from various sources and have standards for validation and the level of detail of the exception messages that should be thrown for bad input. So we quite often end up with code like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic void method(final Long id, final String parameter) {\r\n  Validate.notNull(id, \"id cannot be null\");\r\n  Validate.notEmpty(parameter, \"parameter cannot be an empty string (id=\" + id + \")\");\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe've used @Rule and ExpectedException to test these validations separately so far, and it works ok. But it does sort of feel like a few of lines more than necessary, and we have lot of these types of situations... So this is an attempt to make it slightly easier to test these types of situations, by allowing for constructs like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Test(expectedMessage = \"id cannot be null\")\r\npublic void shouldThrowExceptionForMissingId() {\r\n  service.method(null, \"Something\");\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Test(expectedMessage = \"parameter cannot be empty\")\r\npublic void shouldThrowExceptionForMissingParameter() {\r\n  service.method(1L, null);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nI've tried following code standards and placed logic where it seemed appropriate, but I'm open to any and all criticism. I also hope this is the correct way of trying to make a contribution, I had to do some reading on how Github works ;)."

  "body" : "Hi guys.\r\n\r\nAs of #198, I created a DescriptionBuilder that generates immutable Description classes.\r\n\r\nIn order to be backward compatible I extended the Description class with two new classes SuiteDescription  & TestDescription that represent the two parts. In order to create a SuiteDescription you must now provide a list of children, whereas a TestDescription is generated without.\r\n\r\nI didn't make use of the annotations, as it felt wrong and way to complicated to do so. With the builder pattern we can add individual attributes without blowing up the number of constructors. Moreover, clients may write their own builders and create subclasses of SuiteDescription or TestDescription for their own needs.\r\n\r\nI think this is a solution that we can live with for a long time.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't like is, that I needed to override the addChild() method to throw an Exception in order to make the subtypes immutable. Even though the addChild() method is marked deprecated and I added a warning JavaDoc for this, maybe there is a better way to solve this. Let me know if so.\r\n\r\nI am looking forward to hearing your feedback.\r\n\r\nAll the best\r\nbechte "
