  "body" : "Currently, the resolving strategy of the test runner is very static. The only way for a Runner to participate is via the @RunWith annotation. This is more than fine as long as the runner does only support top-level classes.\r\n\r\nNow with the HierarchicalContextRunner (see https://github.com/bechte/junit-hierarchicalcontextrunner), which has more and more stargazers, it's somehow different. This runner supports member classes and uses them to form a context hierarchy, i.e. member classes will inherit all initializations from the outer classes, without having to extend them. This is a great benefit.\r\n\r\nNow, when the tests are executed, everything is fine. But when someone restarts a test of a lower hierarchy, then the test tools does not recognize the @RunWith annotation of the top-level class. Instead it tries to run the very most inner-class with the default JUnit4 runner, leading to a \"The inner class XYZ is not static.\"-Exception.\r\n\r\nI wish we could have an extension point other that the @RunWith annotation, that allows us to contribute to the way, JUnit resolves the runner, namely, the Computer mechanism should be more extendible.\r\n\r\nIf that's not possible, maybe we can change the current Computer in such a way, that given a non-static member class, the Computer resolves the top level class and verifies if this class is annotated with @RunWith and uses this runner instead of the default JUnit4 runner, which anyways does not support this kind of classes, at all.\r\n\r\nFor the latter approach, we would only have to change the current implementation of the AnnotatedBuilder.runnerForClass(Class) method to perform the check within a for-loop (see attached pull request).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about this change?"

  "body" : "Hello,\r\nI am still learning JUnit so I may be having weird ideas, but I don't understand why something like this isn't available.\r\n\r\nI've read that the 'standard' way to check that a method is throwing an exception is to add the 'expected' tag to the Test annotation. \r\nBut I see two problems with that:\r\n- You can't tell exactly which line in the test method is supposed to throw the exception\r\n- If you are testing different way to throw one specific exception, you won't be able to tell if it has been throws everytime as expected. And you will have to create several methods to test for the same exception.\r\nI find it confusing in a general way because the test corresponds to the method and not to an actual part of the program we're trying to test.\r\n\r\nI think the exceptions should be checked using a method. Here's what I have in mind:\r\n\r\nassertThrows(TestException.class, new Testable() {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void test() {\r\n        // Call tested method here\r\n    });\r\n\r\nHere TestException is the exception class we're expecting the method to throw. \r\nassertThrows calls test(), tries to catch a Throwable, and checks if it is of type TestException, or a subtype of TestException. If no exception is caught, or if the exception is not of the expected type, the test fails.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to have something like this?"
