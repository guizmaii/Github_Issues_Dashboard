I suspect the same failure will occur with other coverage analysis tools. Having this fixed helps in order to have a JUnit's coverage analyzed in a continuous integration tool.\n\nThe cause of the problem is that Jacoco generates extra methods to conduct the instrumentation, which are then included in the sorted result (and which the test case does not expect).\n\nA simple solution is to refine the equality check so that only the order of the methods actually declared is verified.\n\nI've this solution almost ready, which I'll post as a pull request once I'm done.\n"

  "body" : "**The issue (#551):**\nWith [Jacoco](http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/) (formerly eclemma) code coverage enabled in Eclipse, the `org.junit.internal.MethodSorterTest` failed on\n* `getMethodsNullSorter`\n* `testDefaultSorter`\n* `testNameAsc`\n\nThe cause was that via reflection methods were collected from static classes. These included temporary methods generated by the coverage tool, which were not expected by the test causing the test to fail.\n\n**The fix**\nTo fix this, I filter methods before comparison, to just the methods actually declared. This is done by the new `getDeclaredFilteredMethods` helper method. As a result, all tests pass both with and without coverage analysis enabled.\n\nI also applied some small refactorings. I extracted separate test cases for method sorting on sub and superclasses (which were included in the null sorter test case). Furthermore, I based all equality checks directly on lists or arrays, instead of on the `toString` representation of objects.\n\n"

Even worse, it can lead to undetected misbehavior if you forget to annotate your Rule properly. With a SystemPropertyRule, for example, leaving out the @Rule annotation leads to the Rule behaving properly within the Test, but not resetting the System Property after the test has run.\r\n\r\nA simple fix would be to reflectively go through the fields of the Test-class and ensure, that all field types implementing TestRule are marked with @(Class)Rule (and all methods returning a type implementing TestRule).\r\n\r\nOn approval, I would implement the change and submit a pull request."
