  "body" : "Theories are great, and they've been helping me produce some really nice tests, but now I want to define theories on every value of an enum, and failures here are quite tricky to debug because the error messages aren't too useful. \r\n\r\nThe unit test in this acts as a good example. It defines an enum, uses enum.values() as `@DataPoints` and then contains a theory called theoryTest that fails for one of the enum values. The error message this gives is `ParameterizedAssertionError: theoryTest(allValues[1])`.\r\n\r\nThis isn't that helpful, since the enum could be ordered in any way and still be broadly equivalent (and if it's coming from external code, the order could happily change arbitrarily). This is particularly annoying when you have a massive enum, want to check a theory for all values in it, at which point this error becomes entirely useless until you manually debug the theory, or count one by one through the current enum values. I've been retrofitting some theories around some old code with some fairly large enums, and this is not a fun place to be. By definition though, enum values already have meaningful names, and it'd be better if these were used, giving errors like `ParameterizedAssertionError: theoryTest(BAD_VALUE)`.\r\n\r\n(In addition there's the specific enum case, where the datapoint is `@Datapoint public static ENUM enumValue = ENUM.A_MEANINGFUL_NAME`. Here the message blames `theoryTest(enumValue)`. That's not useful, and this is really only useful if you reliably name the datapoint variable holding your enum the same as the enum value's name anyway. Less annoying, but since it already has a real name that should describe it perfectly well already, it would be good to use that)\r\n\r\nAttached code now does all of this, using the enum name (via toString(), since the Enum docs recommend using that instead of .name()) instead of the variable name, if the variable refers to an enum or array of enums. Enums seem like an acceptable special case for this, since they're a base Java type that's already a value with a name by definition. Sound reasonable?"

  "body" : "This fixes #125. In that issue, tests with non-static or non-public datapoint methods are ignored because they're not checked for when constructing the instance, and when the values are retrieved for theory parameters in getValue() in MethodParameterValue (in AllMembersSupplier) an exception is thrown, but then swallowed in addMultiPointMethods/addSinglePointMethods in AllMembersSupplier. \r\n\r\nThere's another abandoned pull request trying fixing this in #328, which rethrows all exceptions thrown in datapoint methods, including this one. This is arguably dubious since you could potentially have other exceptions coming from datapoint methods, and it's not clear whether those should actually fail tests. This commit does not affect issue 137 (caused by the exception hiding), which #328 does try to solve.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, datapoint methods that are definitely being entirely ignored are a legitimately incorrect use of the datapoints annotation, and that should actually fail, I think.\r\n\r\nWhile there was no error before this for non-static datapoint methods, there was an initialization error for non-static/non-public `@DataPoint` fields. There wasn't an error for `@DataPoints` array fields though, for no possible good reason I can see, since this doesn't have any of the same exception hiding issues as the methods do.\r\n\r\nWith this commit all of the above is fixed, by adding checks on test initialization that look at all the datapoint methods and fields, and confirms that they're public and static. This already existed for fields annotated with `@DataPoint`, but now also covers array fields annotated with `@DataPoints` and array and singleton annotated datapoint methods."
